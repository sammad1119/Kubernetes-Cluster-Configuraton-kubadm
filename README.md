Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform developed by Google. It helps in automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Containers are a lightweight, portable, and scalable way to package and run applications, and Kubernetes provides the infrastructure needed to deploy and manage these containers at scale.

<b>Here's a breakdown of what Kubernetes does:</b>

1. Automated deployment: Kubernetes allows you to define how your applications should be deployed using declarative configuration files. It then automates the deployment process, ensuring that your applications are running as specified.
2. Scaling: Kubernetes makes it easy to scale your applications up or down based on demand. You can define scaling rules and policies, and Kubernetes will automatically adjust the number of containers running your application to handle changes in traffic or workload.
3. Management: Kubernetes provides a range of features for managing your applications, including service discovery, load balancing, and storage orchestration. It also includes built-in health checking and self-healing capabilities, so it can automatically restart containers that fail or become unresponsive.
4. Portability: Kubernetes runs on any infrastructure, whether it's on-premises, in the cloud, or a hybrid of both. This makes it easy to move your applications between different environments without having to make significant changes to your deployment configuration.
